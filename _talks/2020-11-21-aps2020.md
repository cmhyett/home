Recently, there has been a lot of interest in applying machine learning techniques to capture Lagrangian dynamics of fluid particles in turbulent flows. We extend this work in search of Lagrangian dynamics of coarse-grained fluid volume/geometry and velocity gradient. Our work builds on the machine learning of Lagrangian dynamics, as well as the development of phenomenological reduced order models by approximating the closure of a physics-based model using neural networks to create a parameterized stochastic differential equation; coupling the evolution of the geometry to the evolution of the coarse-grained dynamical quantities; including deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Further, because the stochastic terms are themselves parameterized, we are able to target higher-order moments of dynamical quantities of interest. We train and evaluate the parameterized SDE against filtered Lagrangian DNS data to obtain a data-driven closure to the hypothesized model. We then evaluate the trained model to recover the learned insights to the phenomenological model.
